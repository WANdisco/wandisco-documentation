Use this quickstart if you want to configure Fusion to replicate from ADLS Gen1 to ADLS Gen2 storage.

What this guide will cover:

- Installing WANdisco Fusion using the [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) tool.
- Integrating WANdisco Fusion with ADLS Gen1 and ADLS Gen2 storage.

## Prerequisites

|For info on how to create a suitable VM with all services installed, see our [Azure VM creation](../preparation/azure_vm_creation.md) guide. See our [VM Preparation](../preparation/vm_prep.md) guide for how to install the services only.|
|---|

To complete this install, you will need:

* ADLS Gen1 storage account.
* ADLS Gen2 storage account with [hierarchical namespace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-namespace) enabled.
  * You will also need a container created inside this account.
* Azure Virtual Machine (VM).
  * Minimum size recommendation = **16 vcpus, 32 GiB memory** (e.g. [Standard F16s v2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/fsv2-series?toc=/azure/virtual-machines/linux/toc.json&bc=/azure/virtual-machines/linux/breadcrumb/toc.json)).
  * A minimum of 24GB available storage for the `/var/lib/docker` directory.
    * If creating your VM through the Azure portal (and not via our [guide](../preparation/azure_vm_creation.md)), you may have insufficient disk space by default. See the [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/expand-os-disk) for further info.

* The following services must be installed on the VM:
  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (v19.03.5 or higher)
  * [Docker Compose for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose) (v1.25.0 or higher)

### Info you will require

* ADLS Gen1 storage account details:
  * [Hostname / Endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-lake-store/data-lake-store-get-started-portal#create-a-data-lake-storage-gen1-account) (Example: `<account-name>.azuredatalakestore.net`)
    * The following [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/dls/account?view=azure-cli-latest#az-dls-account-list) command will get a list of Data Lake Store accounts and endpoints:
    `az dls account list --output table`
  * [Home Mount Point / Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-lake-store/data-lake-store-get-started-portal#createfolder) (Example: `/` or `/path/to/mountpoint`)
    * Fusion will be able to read and write to everything contained within the Mount Point.
  * [Client ID / Application ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#get-values-for-signing-in) (Example: `a73t6742-2e93-45ty-bd6d-4a8art6578ip`)
  * [Refresh URL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/azuread-dev/v1-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow#service-to-service-access-token-request) (Example: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/oauth2/token`)
    * The `<tenant-id>` is a value given to the service principal during creation, see the [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#get-values-for-signing-in) for how to retrieve this.
  * [Handshake User / Service principal name](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#create-an-azure-active-directory-application) (Example: `fusion-app`)
  * [ADL credential / Application secret](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#create-a-new-application-secret) (Example: `8A767YUIa900IuaDEF786DTY67t-u=:]`)

* ADLS Gen2 storage account details:
  * [Account name](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal#create-a-storage-account) (Example: `adlsg2storage`)
  * [Container name](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal#create-a-container) (Example: `fusionreplication`)
  * [Access key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage#view-access-keys-and-connection-string) (Example: `eTFdESnXOuG2qoUrqlDyCL+e6456789opasweghtfFMKAHjJg5JkCG8t1h2U1BzXvBwtYfoj5nZaDF87UK09po==`)

## Installation

Log in to your VM prior to starting these steps.

### Setup Fusion

1. Clone the Fusion docker repository:

   `git clone https://github.com/WANdisco/fusion-docker-compose.git`

1. Change to the repository directory:

   `cd fusion-docker-compose`

1. Run the setup script:

   `./setup-env.sh`

1. Choose the `ADLS Gen1 to Gen2` option when prompted.

1. You have now completed the setup. To create and start your containers run:

   `docker-compose up -d`

   Docker will now download all required images and create the containers.

## Configuration

### Configure the ADLS Gen1 storage

1. Log in to Fusion via a web browser.

   `http://<docker_IP_address>:8081`

   Enter your email address and choose a password you will remember.

1. Click on the **Settings** cog for the **ADLS GEN1** storage, and select the **ADLS Gen1** storage type.

1. Fill in the details for your ADLS Gen1 storage account. See the [Info you will require](#info-you-will-require) section for reference.

1. Click **Apply Configuration** and wait for this to complete.

### Configure the ADLS Gen2 storage

1. Click on the **Settings** cog for the **ADLS GEN2** storage, and select the **ADLS Gen2** storage type.

1. Fill in the details for your ADLS Gen2 storage account. See the [Info you will require](#info-you-will-require) section for reference.

1. Check the **Use Secure Protocol** box.

1. Click **Apply Configuration** and wait for this to complete.

## Migration

Follow the steps below to demonstrate the migration of data from your ADLS Gen1 to Gen2 storage.

### Get sample data

Upload sample data to your ADLS Gen1 storage account, see the [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-lake-store/data-lake-store-get-started-portal#uploaddata) for guidance.

You can get the sample data from the link below:

[customer_addresses_dim.tsv.gz](https://github.com/pivotalsoftware/pivotal-samples/raw/master/sample-data/customer_addresses_dim.tsv.gz)

Place it within your **Home Mount Point** (see [info you will require](#info-you-will-require) for reference).

### Create replication rule

On the dashboard, create a **HCFS** rule with the following parameters:

* Rule Name = `migration`
* Path for all storages = `/`
* Default exclusions
* Preserve HCFS Block Size = *False*

### Migrate your data

1. On the dashboard, view the `migration` rule.

1. Start your migration with the following settings:

   * Source Storage = **adls1**
   * Target Storage = **adls2**
   * Overwrite Settings = **Skip**

1. Wait until the migration is complete, and check the contents of your ADLS Gen2 container.

   A new ~50MB file will exist inside (`customer_addresses_dim.tsv.gz`).

_You have now successfully migrated data from your ADLS Gen1 to your ADLS Gen2 storage using LiveMigrator._

## Troubleshooting

* See our [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/general_troubleshooting.md) guide for help.

_Contact [WANdisco](https://wandisco.com/contact) for further information about Fusion and what it can offer you._

## Reference architecture

![Architecture: ADLS Gen1 to ADLS Gen2](/wandisco-documentation/img/arch_adlsg1_adlsg2.jpg)

1. When initiating a migration, Fusion LiveMigrator will scan the ADLS Gen1 storage.
1. Any new files or differences are read by the Fusion IHC in the ADLS Gen1 zone, and replicated to the Fusion Server in the ADLS Gen2 zone.
1. The Fusion Server in the ADLS Gen2 zone will transform the ADLS Gen1 data to equivalent ADLS Gen2 changes. LiveMigrator will overwrite or skip existing files on the ADLS Gen2 storage depending on the settings used.

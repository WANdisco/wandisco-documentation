Define Java Environment Overrides by selecting **Advanced Settings** from the **Storage Configuration** menu. This is useful when you want to include additional Java arguments that are not included by default. You can also adjust existing settings (such as Java Heap for the LiveData Plane services).

See our [community article](https://community.wandisco.com/s/article/java-environment-override) for examples on how the overrides can be used.

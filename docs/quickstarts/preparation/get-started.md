WANdisco LiveData Plane allows you to connect to different storages and transfer data between them.

Choose how to set up LiveData Plane depending on your goals.

## Dockerized LiveData Plane

Learn how to migrate and replicate data with LiveData Plane and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) in pre-configured environments.

All Dockerized LiveData Plane environments come with the [LiveMigrator plugin](https://docs.wandisco.com/bigdata/wdfusion/plugins/live-migrator/6.0) for testing migrations.

## Manage existing deployments

Manage existing LiveData Plane deployments by connecting them to a centralized user interface (UI).

All LiveData Plane operations can then be carried out from this interface.

## Next steps

Choose one of these options and follow the tailored guides to prepare, install, and test your environment.

## Skills required

These guides assume you have:

* Basic Linux skills.
* Knowledge of your Cloud and/or Hadoop environment.

Refer to the **Operation** guides for instructions on how to use the UI.

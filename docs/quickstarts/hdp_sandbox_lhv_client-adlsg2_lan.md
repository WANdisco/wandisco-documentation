_THIS GUIDE IS WORK IN PROGRESS, PLEASE DO NOT FOLLOW ANYTHING HERE UNTIL THIS WARNING IS REMOVED_

[//]: <This quickstart is work in progress, and new items are still being added. The development approach is that all known workarounds/configuration steps will be kept in the document until we have fully confirmed their fix (see MTC label). At which point, they will be removed. The same will apply for configuration/installation steps when blueprints for HDP or Fusion have been completed (see DAP-144).>

Use this quickstart if you want to configure Fusion to replicate from a Hortonworks (HDP) Sandbox to an Azure Databricks cluster.

This will involve the use of Live Hive for the HDP cluster, and the Databricks Delta Lake plugin for the Azure Databricks cluster. These two products form the LiveAnalytics solution.

What this guide will cover:

- Installing WANdisco Fusion using the [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) tool.
- Integrating WANdisco Fusion with Azure Databricks.
- Performing a sample data migration.

Please see the [shutdown and start up](https://wandisco.github.io/wandisco-documentation/docs/quickstarts/hdp_sandbox_fusion_stop_start) guide for when you wish to safely shutdown or start back up the installation.

## Prerequisites

[//]: <We are still working out the minimum VM requirements, at the moment, we are working with Standard D8 v3.>

To complete this quickstart, you will need:

* Azure VM created and started. See the [Azure VM creation](https://wandisco.github.io/wandisco-documentation/docs/quickstarts/preparation/azure_vm_creation) guide for steps to create an Azure VM.
  * Minimum size VM recommendation = **Standard D8 v3 (8 vcpus, 32 GiB memory).**
  * CentOS-based 7.7 (or higher) or UbuntuLTS 18.04. Instructions are provided for these releases.
  * A minimum of 128GB storage. The [Azure VM creation](https://wandisco.github.io/wandisco-documentation/docs/quickstarts/preparation/azure_vm_creation) guide includes this by default.
  * Root access on server (this is normally available by default).
* Azure VM prepared for Fusion installation, see [Azure VM preparation](https://wandisco.github.io/wandisco-documentation/docs/quickstarts/preparation/azure_vm_prep) guide for all required steps.

## Installation

Please log into your VM prior to starting these steps. All the commands within this guidance should be run as **root** user.

### Setup Fusion

[//]: <Still not determined as to where the users will pull the fusion-docker-compose repository. We will need to provide pre-baked config files so that the only entries required will be the ADLS Gen2 details.>

1. (**TBC - branch name**) Clone the Fusion docker repository to your Azure VM instance:

   `git clone https://github.com/WANdisco/fusion-docker-compose.git`

2. Change to the repository directory:

   `cd fusion-docker-compose`

3. Run the setup script:

   `./setup-env.sh`

4. Follow the prompts to configure your ADLS Gen2 Zone, see the next section below for guidance on this.

#### Setup prompts for ADLS Gen2

Please ensure to enter your details for the **Storage account**, **Storage container** and **Account Key** values so that they match your account in Azure.
The examples shown below are for guidance only.

* Storage account: `adlsg2storage`

* Storage container: `fusionreplication`

* Account key: `KEY_1_STRING` - the Primary Access Key is now referred to as "Key1" in Microsoftâ€™s documentation. You can get the Access Key from the Microsoft Azure storage account under the **Access Keys** section.

* default FS: `abfss://fusionreplication@adlsg2storage.dfs.core.windows.net/` - press enter for the default value.

* underlying FS: `abfs://fusionreplication@adlsg2storage.dfs.core.windows.net/` - press enter for the default value.

At this point, the setup prompts will be complete and the script will exit out with an informational message. Please ignore this for now and continue following the steps below.

### Startup Fusion

After all the prompts have been completed, you will be able to start the containers.

1. Ensure that Docker is started:

   `systemctl status docker`

   If not, start the Docker service:

   `systemctl start docker`

2. Start the Fusion containers with:

   `docker-compose up -d`

## Configuration

### Live Hive configuration and activation

1. Log into the Fusion UI for the HDP zone, and activate the Live Hive plugin.

   `http://<docker_IP_address>:8083`

   Username: `admin`
   Password: `admin`

   Proceed to the Settings tab and select the *Live Hive: Plugin Activation* option on the left-hand panel.

   Click on the *Activate* option. Wait for the **Reload this window** message to appear and refresh the page.

### Setup Databricks
[//]: <> (Host live-analytics-databricks-etl-6.0.0.1.jar externally - cuts the steps right down)

Prior to performing these tasks, the Databricks cluster must be in a **running** state. Please access the Azure portal and check the status of the cluster. If it is not running, select to start the cluster and wait until it is **running** before continuing.

1. Log into the Fusion UI for the ADLS Gen2 zone.

   `http://<docker_IP_address>:8583`

   Username: `admin`

2. Enter the Databricks Configuration details on the Settings page.

   **Fusion UI -> Settings -> Databricks: Configuration**

   _Examples for Databricks details_

   * Databricks Service Address: `westeurope.azuredatabricks.net`

   * Bearer Token: `dapicd7689jkb25473c765ghty78bb299a83`

   * Databricks Cluster ID: `2233-255452-boned277`

   * Unique JDBC HTTP path: `sql/protocolv1/o/6987013384345789/2233-255452-boned277`

   _Ensure to change the above examples to match your Databricks details._

   Click **Update** once complete.

3. Download Jar file from Repo

   https://github.com/mo-martin/wandisco-documentation/raw/hdp-adls-quickstart-refinements/docs/quickstarts/resources/live-analytics-databricks-etl-6.0.0.1.jar

[//]: <DAP-135 workaround>

4. Log into the Azure portal and Launch Workspace for your Databricks cluster.

5. On the left-hand panel, select **Clusters** and then select your interactive cluster.

6. Click on the **Libraries** tab, and select the option to **Install New**.

7. Select the following options for the Install Library prompt:

   * Library Source = `Upload`

   * Library Type = `Jar`

   * File Path = Find save location of `datatransformer.jar` from step 3.

8. Select **Install** once the details are entered. Wait for the **Status** of the jar to display as **Installed** before continuing.

## Replication

In this section, follow the steps detailed to perform live replication of HCFS data and Hive metadata from the HDP cluster to the Azure Databricks cluster.

### Create replication rules

1. Log into the Fusion UI for the HDP zone.

   `http://<docker_IP_address:8083`

   Username: `admin`
   Password: `admin`

2. Enter the Replication tab, and select to **+ Create** a replication rule.

3. Create a new HCFS rule using the UI with the following properties:

   * Type = `HCFS`

   * Zones = `adls2, sandbox-hdp` _- Leave as default._

   * Priority Zone = `sandbox-hdp` _- Leave as default._

   * Rule Name = `warehouse`

   * Path for adls2 = `/apps/hive/warehouse`

   * Path for hdp = `/apps/hive/warehouse`

   Click **Add** after entering the Rule Name and Paths.

   * Advanced Options: Preserve Origin Block Size = `true` _- click the checkbox to set this to true._

   Click **Create rules (1)** once complete.

4. Create a new Hive rule using the UI with the following properties:

   On the Replication tab, select to **+ Create** a replication rule again.

   * Type = `Hive`

   * Database name = `test*`

   * Table name = `*`

   * Description = `Testing` _- this field is optional_

   Click **Create rule** once complete.

5. Both rules should now display on the **Replication** tab in the Fusion UI.

### Test replication

Prior to performing these tasks, the Databricks cluster must be in a **running** state. Please access the Azure portal and check the status of the cluster. If it is not running, select to start the cluster and wait until it is **running** before continuing.

Tez Memory size may need to be reduced, this can be done by visiting http://docker_IP_address:8080/#/main/services/TEZ/configs then setting `tez.am.resource.memory.mb` to `1024`

1. On the docker host, log into the HDP cluster node.

   `docker exec -it docker_sandbox-hdp_1 bash`

2. Run beeline and use the `!connect` string to start a Hive session via the Hiveserver2 service.

   `beeline`

   `beeline> !connect jdbc:hive2://sandbox-hdp:2181/;serviceDiscoveryMode=zooKeeper;zooKeeperNamespace=hiveserver2`

   This connection string can also be found on the Ambari UI under **Hive -> Summary -> HIVESERVER2 JDBC URL**.

   When prompted for a username and password, enter the following:

   `Enter username: hdfs`

   `Enter password: ` _- leave blank and press enter._

2. Create a database to use that will match the regex for the Hive replication rule created earlier in the Fusion UI.

   `0: jdbc:hive2://sandbox-hdp:2181/> create database test01;`

3. Create a table inside of the database.

   `0: jdbc:hive2://sandbox-hdp:2181/> use test01;`

   `0: jdbc:hive2://sandbox-hdp:2181/> create table table01(id int, name string) stored as ORC;`

4. Insert data inside of the table.

   `0: jdbc:hive2://sandbox-hdp:2181/> insert into table01 values (1,'words');`

   This will now launch a Hive job that will insert the data values provided in this example. If this is successful, you will see **SUCCEEDED** written in the STATUS column.

   _Example_

   ```json
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
           VERTICES      STATUS  TOTAL  COMPLETED  RUNNING  PENDING  FAILED  KILLED
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Map 1 ..........   SUCCEEDED      1          1        0        0       0       0
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   VERTICES: 01/01  [==========================>>] 100%  ELAPSED TIME: XY.ZA s
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ```

   Please note that running an 'insert into table' for the first time on the HDP cluster may take a longer period of time than normal. Further jobs will complete at a much faster rate.

### Verify replication

1. To verify the data values inside of the table on the **HDP** zone, run the command below when still logged into the Hive beeline session:

   `0: jdbc:hive2://sandbox-hdp:2181/> select * from table01;`

   The output will be similar to that of below:

   ```json
   +-------------+----------------+--+
   | table01.id  |  table01.name  |
   +-------------+----------------+--+
   | 1           | words          |
   +-------------+----------------+--+
   1 rows selected (X.YZA seconds)
   ```

2. To verify the data has replicated to the ADLS Gen2 zone and Databricks cluster, access the Azure portal and and Launch Workspace for your Databricks cluster (if not already opened).

3. On the left-hand panel, select **Data** and then select the database created for this test (i.e. `test01`).

4. In the _Tables_ list, select the table created for this test (i.e. `table01`).

5. Wait for the table details to be loaded, and verify that the Schema and Sample Data match that seen in the HDP zone.

   **Schema**
   ```json
   col_name   data_type
   id         int
   name       string
   ```

   **Sample Data**
   ```json
   id         name
   1          words
   ```

## Troubleshooting

Please see the [Useful information](https://wandisco.github.io/wandisco-documentation/docs/quickstarts/troubleshooting/useful_info) section for additional commands and help.

### Error 'connection refused' after starting Fusion for the first time

You may see the following error occur when running `docker-compose up -d` for the first time inside the fusion-docker-compose repository:

```json
ERROR: Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/: dial tcp: lookup registry-1.docker.io on [::1]:53: read udp [::1]:52155->[::1]:53: read: connection refused
```

If encountering this error, run the `docker-compose up -d` command again, and this should initiate the download of the docker images.

### Fusion zones not inducted together

[//]: <DAP-136 workaround>

If the Fusion zones are not inducted together after starting Fusion for the first time (`docker-compose up -d`), you can simply run the same command again to start the induction container:

`docker-compose up -d`

### Hiveserver2 down after HDP Sandbox is started

The Hiveserver2 component in the HDP sandbox may be down after starting the cluster. If so, try the following steps to start it back up.

1. On the docker host, change directory to the Fusion docker compose directory and restart the Fusion Server container for the HDP zone.

   `cd /path/to/fusion-docker-compose`

   `docker-compose restart fusion-server-hdp`

   Wait until the container has finished restarting before continuing.

2. Access the Ambari UI, and manually start the Hiveserver2 component.

   **Ambari UI -> Hive -> Summary -> Click on the "HIVESERVER2" written in blue text.**

3. Locate the HiveServer2 in the component list and click the `...` in the Action column. Select to **Start** the component in the drop-down list.

### Spark2 History Server down after HDP Sandbox is started for first time

When starting the HDP Sandbox for the first time, the Spark2 History Server may be in a stopped state. This is often due to the order in which Spark2 and the WANdisco Fusion client is installed.

To resolve and bring the History Server online, follow the steps below:

1. In the Ambari UI, select to Refresh configs for the WANdisco Fusion service.

   **Ambari UI -> WANdisco Fusion -> Actions -> Refresh configs -> OK**

2. Start the Spark2 service.

   **Ambari UI -> Spark2 -> Actions -> Start -> CONFIRM START**

## Advanced options

* This guide does not currently offer configuration of Fusion to a **Kerberized** HDP cluster.
* This guide does not currently offer configuration of Fusion to a NameNode HA HDP cluster.

Please contact [WANdisco](https://wandisco.com/contact) for further information on Fusion with docker.

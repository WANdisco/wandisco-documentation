Once you have [added your storages](../installation/connect-to-storages.md), you can test your environment.

note:::
You will need at least two storages before you can start testing.
:::

Refer to the following guides to test functionality:

1. [Create a replication rule](../operation/create-rule.md).
1. If you have the LiveMigrator plugin as part of your installation, perform a [migration](../operation/migration.md).
1. If you have live replication enabled on your storage(s), write some data inside the replicated rule path.
1. Run a [consistency check](../operation/consistency-check.md).

## Next steps

You can continue to create rules and migrate/replicate your data as needed.

See our [troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/ui-troubleshooting.md) guide for additional help.

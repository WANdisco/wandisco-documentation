Keeping data consistent in a distributed environment is a massive challenge.

Here are some examples of the features WANdisco offer:


* Flexible selective replication defined at a per-folder level or per-data set.

* Compatibility with common security protocols â€“ Kerberos, SSL/TLS, LDAP.

* Quickly compare and validate data consistency between zones and replicated environments.

* Replicate encrypted at-rest data between different platforms.

* Network trace is between WANdisco Fusion servers so that application environments can stay isolated.

* UI-controlled throttling of network bandwidth utilization.

* API support of server administration and automation.

* Data is replicated and stored in cloud native formats for direct access by applications and services.

* Run applications in multiple, geographically separate locations with local endpoints in each.

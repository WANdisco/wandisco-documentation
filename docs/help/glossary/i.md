## IHC Server
Inter Hadoop Communication servers handle the traffic that runs between zones or data centers that use different versions of Hadoop. IHC Servers are matched to the version of Hadoop running locally. Itâ€™s possible to deploy different numbers of IHC servers at each data center, additional IHC Servers can form part of a High Availability mechanism.

## Induction
Induction adds a node to the LiveData Plane ecosystem, either as a new Zone or to an existing Zone.

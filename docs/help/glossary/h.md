## Hadoop
Hadoop is an open source software framework for storing data and running applications on clusters of commodity hardware. It provides storage for any kind of data, enormous processing power and the ability to handle virtually limitless concurrent tasks or jobs.

## Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
HDFS is a standard distributed file system written in Java. It stores a large amount of data placed across multiple machines, and provides excellent data throughput and access through the MapReduce algorithm, high fault tolerance and native support of large data sets. The HDFS architecture consists of clusters, each of which is accessed through a single Name Node software tool installed on a separate machine to monitor and manage the that clusterâ€™s file system and user access mechanism. The other machines install one instance of Data Node to manage cluster storage.

## HCFS
Hadoop Compatible File System.


## HDInsight
HDInsight deploys and creates Apache Hadoop clusters in the cloud, providing a software framework designed to manage, analyze, and report on big data with high reliability and availability. HDInsight uses the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) Hadoop distribution. Hadoop often refers to the entire Hadoop ecosystem of components, which includes Apache Hadoop, Apache Storm and Apache HBase clusters, as well as other technologies under the Hadoop umbrella.

## High Availability
Provides continuous hot backup, while making failover and disaster recovery automatic and transparent for both developers and administrators.

## Hive
Hive is a data warehouse software project built on top of Apache Hadoop for providing data summarization, query, and analysis. Hive gives an SQL-like interface to query data stored in various databases and file systems that integrate with Hadoop.
